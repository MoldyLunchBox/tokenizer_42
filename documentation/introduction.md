## Introduction to Blockchain:

Blockchain is a decentralized and distributed ledger technology that securely records transactions across a network of computers. Unlike traditional centralized databases, blockchain operates through a consensus mechanism, where transactions are verified and added to the ledger in a secure and immutable manner. Each block in the blockchain contains a set of transactions, and once added, it becomes a permanent part of the ledger, forming a chain of blocks.
